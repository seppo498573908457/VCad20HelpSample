		<h2 id="General_information">General information</h2>
		<p>VituixCAD is loudspeaker simulation software.
			Design philosophy is to simulate loudspeaker behavior in full space or half space.
			Even though emphasis is on power response, polar responses and directivity index,
			it is possible to design a loudspeaker without comprehensive angled measurements.
			This is not encouraged though.
		</p>
		<p>Software package includes everything one needs for simulating and designing a loudspeaker.
			Additional to crossover simulator, there is enclosure simulator, diffraction simulator,
			response tracer, response merger, response calculator, auxiliary calculator and FFT tool included.
		</p>

		<h3 id="System_requirements">System requirements</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>VituixCAD is tested on Windows 7 sp1, Vista sp2, 8, 8.1, 10 and 11</li>
			<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42642">Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.2</a></li>
			<li>Minimum screen resolution is 1280x720 (16:9), but 1600x900 or more is recommended.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Recommended platform is <strong>Windows 10 or 11</strong> in real or virtual machine such as VMware (Player 16) or VirtualBox.
			Runs also on Wine with .NET 4.5.2 installed, but it's not quaranteed.

			<li>Read this document.
				Especially section <a href="#Checklist_for_designing_a_loudspeaker">Checklist for designing a loudspeaker</a>.</li>
			<li><strong>Note!</strong> Tools and methods which are not listed in 'Checklist for designing a loudspeaker' section are not recommended and needed for final design of typical boxed speakers.
				Also VituixCAD has some tools meant for preliminary or simplified theoretical studies, but otherwise they should be avoided.
				For example graphically traced or downloaded manufacturer's response data is okay for preliminary studies, but not for final crossover design.</li>

		<h2 id="Preface">Preface</h2>
		<p>This user guide is a chronological walkthrough on how to design a loudspeaker with VituixCAD.
			Commonly, design process starts with deciding enclosure size, drivers, radiator type, alignment etc.
			Enclosure tool is used for simulating enclosures, different radiator types and alignments.
			Next step is to have comprehensive set of acoustic and electrical measurements of the construction.
			Diffraction and Merger tools are used for combining far field and near field responses.
			After these prerequisites are met, simulation phase can be started.
			Whether your goal is to design a speaker with or without interim listening tests, you'll need quality control of some sort.
			Some prefer their ears, some prefer measurements.
			If a loudspeaker measures perfectly, but sounds worse than anything you've ever heard, something is terribly wrong.
			This guide will not teach you how to listen a loudspeaker, but will cover basic QC steps.
		</p>
		<p>Building prototypes and crossovers are not covered in this guide.
			This guide will also assume you have suitable measurement gear and software and understanding about how to measure loudspeaker drivers for design purposes.
		</p>
		<h3 id="Checklist_for_designing_a_loudspeaker">Checklist for designing a loudspeaker</h3>
		<p>Investigate acoustic parameters, dimensions, materials and speaker placement possibilities of the listening room.
			It is wise to fix issues of bad environment (the room) first rather than trying to handle everything with massive and complex speaker design.
		</p>
		<h5>Basic engineering</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>Decide acoustic design; type and amount of directivity, radiator types, ways, driver size and count.</li>
			<li>Estimate possible sensitivity range and crossover frequency ranges.</li>
			<li>Select initial drivers and directivity components to reach previous targets.</li>
			<li>Simulate low frequency radiators with <b>Enclosure tool</b>.</li>
			<li>Simulate baffle diffraction with <b>Diffraction tool</b>. Export cabinet impact response to actual measurement distance of far field responses
				and to the longest ever possible listening distance, for example 10 meters.</li>
			<li>Design the cabinet.</li>
		</ul>
		<h5>Construction</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>Build flexible prototype or final cabinet depending on uncertainties in the design</li>
			<li>Connect temporary cables to individual drivers (or driver groups) for acoustical and electrical measurements.</li>
		</ul>
		<h5>Measurements</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>Prepare turning table for polar response measurements.
				Manual turning table is easy to make and fast to use for example with Clio 10-12 or ARTA 1.9 or REW V5.20.14ea27+.
			</li>
			<li>Choose directions for off-axis measurements.
				You are not forced to measure full or half circle around the speaker with constant 5 or 10 deg steps,
				but it is recommended to get correct power &amp; directivity result and simulate reflections and rotate/tilt drivers.
				Simulation is possible with less than 10 directions per axis.
				Don't waste your chance to get all measured data at once.
				There is no need to measure vertical axis if vertical measurement would be &quot;equal enough&quot; to horizontal measurement.
				For example full range driver in the center of square box is symmetrical in both directions.
			</li>
			<li>Measure polar response of each driver (or driver group) as far field measurement.

		<h4 id="Driver_list">Driver list</h4>
		<img class="indent1" alt="driver_list.png" src="images/driver_list.png">
		<p>Drivers in the project are listed in Drivers table.
			Give actual name for initial dummy driver &quot;Driver #1&quot;.
			Add the rest with (+) button and enter actual names.
			Enter nominal SPL and Z if you're making just simple tests without measured or simulated frequency and impedance responses.
			That will scale flat default responses without adjusting via Scaling text boxes.
		</p>
		<p>Click color palette button on the right side of Drivers table to adjust color, width and dash style
			of driver traces in SPL, GD &amp; Phase, Filter and Power dissipation charts.
			Different settings for six driver models are available.
			Magnitude and phase responses can have different properties.
		</p>
		<h4 id="Main_Frequency_responses">Frequency responses</h4>
		<p>Filenames must have valid coding for plane and off-axis angle.
			ARTA style angle coding &lt;name-prefix&gt;_deg[+|-]&lt;num&gt;.txt is okay, as well as CLIO style &lt;name-prefix&gt; &lt;num&gt;.txt where angle &lt;num&gt; is multiplied by 100.
			Different planes should be separated with a keyword, typically 'hor' or 'ver'.<br>
			For example 'M15CH002_hor_deg+110.txt' or simply 'M15CH002 hor 110.txt' equals to M15CH002 to horizontal off-axis angle of 110 degrees with angle multiplier 1.
			'M15CH002 hor 11000.txt' equals to horizontal 110 deg with CLIO naming style having angle multiplier 100.
		</p>
		<p>
			3D balloon data with CLIO, EASE and VACS file naming formats is also supported.
			Program is able to read horizontal (phi=0) and vertical (phi=90 deg) planes from balloon data.
			Rotation of phi by +90 deg may be needed if balloon data is captured with Klippel NFS.
			See <a href="#Angle_parsing_from_filename">Options</a> for more information.
		</p>
		<p>'SPL Horizonal.txt' and 'SPL Vertical.txt' multi-column files exported from Klippel
			are splitted automatically into multiple frd files when loaded to Frequency response list in Drivers tab.
			txt extensions will be renamed to nfs before splitting and loading.
			Number format should be invariant so comma (,) is not accepted decimal separator.
			Note! Files don't include measured phase by default so they are not valid for designing multi-way speaker or phase equalization (to get minimum-phase response).
		</p>
		<p>Add driver's frequency responses by clicking open button or dropping files into response list.
			All files of the driver should be selected in one pass with multi-selection (Ctrl or Shift key pressed) i.e.
			files should locate in the same folder.
			Delete button <strong>X</strong> clears response list.
		</p>
		<p>Maximum of 718 frequency responses per driver is supported in practice.
			Angle step of drivers' off-axis responses could be denser, fewer or equal to angle step of simulation set in Options window.
			Measured angle step could be constant (0, 10, 20, 30, ..., 180) or variable (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80, 100, 120, 150, 180).
			Off-axis responses of different driver types can have different angle step - constant or variable.
		</p>
		<p>Power response and directivity index are calculated within minimum coverage angle of drivers' frequency responses i.e.
			0-180 deg must be measured for all drivers in order to calculate power and directivity to full space.
		</p>
		<img class="indent1" alt="frd_scaling.png" src="images/frd_scaling.png">
		<p>Frequency responses can be scaled (dB), smoothed (none, 1/24, 1/12, 1/6, 1/3, 1/2 oct.), delayed (Â± Âµs),
			polarity inverted, muted and converted to minimum phase with controls below frequency response list.
			Hor and Ver angle can be modified by entering new value to the field if program fails to parse angle value from the filename or measurements are swapped intentionally.
		</p>
		<img class="indent1" alt="reference_angle.png" src="images/reference_angle.png">
		<p>Reference angle is direction in horizontal plane which is shown as On-axis/Ref axis response in SPL, CTA-2034 and Phase response graphs.
			Also directivity index calculation can use reference angle instead of Listening window.
			See CTA-2034-A in Options for more information.
			Optimizing to single off-axis direction is useful if On-axis response is bad or not representative or measurement data is poor and accurate power response is not available.
			Default value is 0 deg hor.
		</p>
		<h4 id="Impedance_response">Impedance response</h4>
		<p>Select impedance response file for a driver(s) by clicking folder button or dropping file into text box.</p>
		<p>Impedance response can be scaled as well with a multiplier.
			If multiple drivers are entered to crossover as a single driver (not recommended), scaled impedance response should represent total impedance of driver group.
			If impedance response was measured from group of drivers in common volume and drivers are entered to crossover as a single drivers (as recommended),
			scaled impedance response should represent single driver.
		</p>
		<h4 id="Supported_response_file_types">Supported response file types</h4>
		<p>VituixCAD supports tab, space or semicolon delimited .txt or .frd or .zma (for impedance).
			Recommended decimal separator is period (.).
			Comma (,) is used as decimal separator if data line doesn't contain periods.
			Comma is used as field/column separator if data line contains both periods and commas.
			Therefore any <strong>thousand separator is not allowed</strong>.
			Following software exports are supported:

		</p>
		<p>Selected component can be replaced by pressing Ctrl key while clicking menu button.
			Active block can be replaced with another active, and passive component (LCR) with another passive.
			Values of parameters with the same name and unit are copied to replacement component.
			Driver, ground, library block and wire cannot be replaced directly without delete-&gt;add.
		</p>
		<h5>Driver instances</h5>
		<p>Each driver instance added in the crossover can be provided with location relative to &quot;design origin&quot;.
			Location is entered to Parameters grid.
			Design origin is typically perpendicular endpoint of listening axis on front baffle surface.
			X [mm] is horizontal coordinate of center point; negative to left and positive to right (mic/listener view).
			Y [mm] is vertical coordinate; negative down and positive up (mic/listener view).
			Z [mm] is horizontal distance coordinate; negative closer to mic and positive further from mic.
		</p>
		<p>Horizontal rotation R [deg] and vertical inclination T [deg] of drivers are also supported.
			Rotation R [deg] is positive to counter-clockwise from top view, and inclination T [deg] is positive to up.
		</p>
		<p>Measurement data in Drivers tab is linked to driver instance in crossover network with a list box located below crossover schematic.
			List box is visible when driver is selected in crossover.
		</p>
		<p>Multiple drivers should be entered as a single driver if they are measured in the prototype cabinet as a package;
			all connected to power amplifier at the same time.
			Location is entered as a difference between measurement and design origins.
		</p>
		<p>Example 1: Location (X,Y,Z) = (0,0,0) if multiple driver package is measured on design (listening) axis.<br>
			Example 2: Location (X,Y,Z) = (0,-400,0) if multiple driver package is measured 400 mm below design (listening) axis.
		</p>
		<h5>Library block menu</h5>
		<p>Library block menu can be filtered shorter with checkboxes in Filter group.
			See searched keywords from tooltip of each checkbox.
			Block is inserted to crossover by double-clicking or with Open button.
			Blocks (vxl files) are also possible to drag &amp; drop with file system from VituixCAD\Library folder to crossover.

		<img class="indent1" alt="block_library.png" src="images/block_library.png">
		<p>Library block could have attributes for calculating component values by user parameters and mathematical expressions.
			Tune block window opens when block is inserted, or Tune block...
			is selected from context menu.
			Values are updated to crossover while parameters are adjusted.
			Attribute values can be solved with Optimizer by checking Opt.
		</p>
		<img class="indent1" alt="tune_block.png" src="images/tune_block.png">
		<p>Purge command disconnects links between block and components, and clears expressions from component parameters which enables modification of previously calculated parameters.
			Purged block disappears when project file is saved.
		</p>
		<p>Wires are added by point &amp; left click, point &amp; left click etc.
			Space or Enter key or right click accepts/terminates wiring.
			Esc key rewinds wire node by node until all nodes are removed.
			Wire is highlighted with lime color when cursor is at valid termination point i.e.
			terminal of a component, or existing node or endpoint of another wire.
			New node is created if wire is started or ended to intermediate point of existing wire,
			or terminal of component is dropped into intermediate point of existing wire in the end of dragging (adding or moving).
		</p>
		<p>Wire can be started from existing wire node or component terminal without clicking wire button in component menu or W shortcut key.
			Creating new node to intermediate point of existing wire requires wiring command.
		</p>
		<p>Red terminal dot of component indicates missing connection.
			Program can handle unconnected terminals but calculation speed is reduced.
		</p>
		<p>Shortcut letter keys are available for adding the most common passive components:<br>
			<strong>C</strong> for capacitor, <strong>L</strong> for inductor, <strong>R</strong> for resistor,
			<strong>M</strong> for transformer, <strong>W</strong> for wire, <strong>G</strong> for ground, <strong>T</strong> for comment text and <strong>D</strong> for driver.
		</p>
		<p>Passive components and texts are added as rotated (=vertical) if Shift key is pressed while clicking component menu or shortcut letter key.</p>
		<h5>Selection</h5>
		<p>Components can be selected for modification by clicking or window selection.
			Multi-selection with Ctrl or Shift key pressed is available for both clicking and window selection.
			Selection set is reset by clicking empty area.
			So called 'Top component' is one of the selected components which parameters are show in Parameters grid below the schematic.
			Top component is emphasized with bold highlight color, typically blue.
			Other selected components (except Top component) are emphasized with semi-transparent highlight color, typically light blue.
			All selected components are targets for moving or modification with context menu or shortcut keys.
		</p>
		<h5>Moving</h5>
		<p>Selected components can be moved by dragging with mouse or arrow keys.
			Wires connected to terminals of moving component are stretching along if component is moved by dragging and <strong>Stretch</strong> is checked.
			Components are disconnected from the network without wire stretching if moved with arrow keys or Stretch is unchecked while dragging.
			Pressing Alt or Shift key while dragging inverts the setting on the fly.
		</p>
		<h5>Modifying</h5>
		<p>Context menu shows possible (and few impossible) actions for the selected components.
			See also shortcut keys.

			Tooltip of the scrollbar shows delay in tap number (1-taps) and percent (%) of taps.<br>
			Pre-delay is usually quite close to 0 ms if XO filter contains IIR equalization, but not reduction of excess group delay at low frequencies.
			Reducing excess group delay at low frequencies requires impulse with "pre-ringing"
			so Pre-delay is usually set close to number of taps to make correction as low frequency as possible.
			Pre-delay could be quite centered with hybrid equalization including both excess delay reduction and IIR equalization.

		<img class="ident1" alt="impulse_response_fr.png" src="images/impulse_response_fr.png">
		<p>Impulse response with finite length or other modifications usually cannot produce a frequency response that is exactly equal to the source response.
			Selected window function, location of window function and location of impulse on the time axis also affect the accuracy of the result.
			Frequency response view (FR view tab) allows you to compare magnitude and phase responses of the selected source response to frequency response generated from impulse response to be exported,
			so that you can choose parameters that get as close to the target as possible.
		</p>
		<p>
			Frequency band to be equalized affects the requirements and parameters.
			For example, high frequencies require less taps than low frequencies.
			DSP gears have limits in total taps, or some maximum latency cannot be exceed so designer is usually forced to distribute available taps for different channels.
			For these reasons, impulse responses of different ways may need to be exported with different parameters: number of taps, pre-delay and window function.
			Different pre-delays need compensation with DSP's delay buffer.

		<p>Purpose of Preference rating (in VituixCAD) is to provide simple target setting and error calculation for the Optimizer.</p>
		<p>Rating is calculated with customizable equation using variables described in patent application

			by Sean Olive.<br>
			Olive's patent application contains many simplifications and negligences measuring just sound balance and coloration with constant signal level.
			For example non-linear distortion, dynamics, stability of sound balance, timing, level of directivity, slope of frequency responses and sound power,
			diffraction, location of radiators, half space and corner concepts are ignored.
			So preference rating alone is not valid design or product ranking benchmark.
			Patent application contains also few mathematical illogicalities and conflicts:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>NBD is sensitive to slope; rating gets worse if response slope is not 0.</li>
			<li>SM is sensitive to slope; rating gets worse if absolute value of response slope is not 1.</li>
			<li>LFX and LFQ fail with directive LF radiators because sound power at LF is lower than LW reference at low mid.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Equation including SM_ON, SM_LW, SM_ER, SM_PIR, SM_SP, AAD_ON, NBD_ON, NBD_PIR, LFX and LFQ
			with adjustable weight 0-5 for each is available.
			Initial weighting factors of variables are visible in the image above.<br>
			Equation provides mathematical approach with less illogicalities and conflicts to be valid for optimizing
			so rating is <b>not compatible</b> with calculations presented in Olive's patent:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Responses are smoothed 1/33 oct (instead of 1/20 oct bands) for AAD and NBD
				to avoid excessive smoothing due to 1/48 oct step of internal frequency points.</li>
			<li>LFX and LFQ are ignored when 'with sub' is checked.
				Rating is scaled to 10 with ideal flat frequency responses and 3rd order Butterworth high-pass at 17.5 Hz.</li>
			<li>NBD is calculated with moving average to eliminate effect of slope.</li>
			<li>SM is calculated as r^2 with slope normalized to -1.0 to eliminate effect of slope.</li>
			<li>LFX is LFX_SP or LFX_LW which one is smaller to support also directive LF radiators having SP significantly below LW at low mid (y_LW).</li>
			<li>LFQ is LFQ_SP or LFQ_LW which one is smaller.</li>
			<li>Optional SL_ON, SL_LW, SL_PIR and SL_SP with adjustable slope targets are available for slope optimization.
				One or more slope target eliminates also unstability if optimized crossover parameters have strong effect to slope.</li>

		<h4 id="Angle_parsing_from_filename">Angle parsing from filename</h4>
		<p>To allow VituixCAD to parse measurement angles and axis from frequency response files, you have to define file naming format/syntax.</p>
		<p><strong>Generic 2D</strong> is configurable option allowing user to specity how plane and angle value are coded in frequency response filename.
			Plane keywords define how to distinguish between horizontal and vertical axis.
			Horizontal axis is selected if keyword of vertical plane is not found in the filename.
			Search from beginning/end defines whether VituixCAD should start parsing angle value from the beginning of the filename (hor +150 drivername.txt) or the end (drivername hor +150.txt).
			Angle multiplied by defines how angle value is formatted.
			For example if 1500 represents 15 degrees off-axis, use Angle multiplied by 100.
			This option is compatible with ARTA, CLIO in 2D mode.
		</p>
		<p><strong>CLIO 3D</strong> filters and decodes either horizontal or vertical plane and angle value from filenames coded by CLIO QC with Auto Save 3-D measurement.
			The syntax follows: NAME &lt;PHI*100&gt; &lt;THETA*100&gt;.txt/frd.
			NAME is root filename, PHI is the polar angle (orbit) and THETA is the azimuth (off-axis) angle.
			These quantities are separated by spaces.
			Other than PHI=0, Â±90, Â±180, Â±270 are skipped because response file handling and directivity graphs support horizontal and vertical planes only.
		</p>
		<p><strong>EASE 3D</strong> filters and decodes either horizontal or vertical plane and angle value from filenames coded by EASE SpeakerLab.
			The syntax follows: NAME IR[mmm][ppp].
			NAME is optional root filename, [mmm] is meridian/orbit and [ppp] is parallel/off-axis angle while the North Pole represents on-axis direction.
			Other than [mmm]=000, 090, 180, 270 are skipped.
		</p>
		<p><strong>VACS 3D</strong> filters and decodes either horizontal or vertical plane and angle value from filenames compatible with Visualizing Acoustics Software (VACS).
			The syntax follows: NAME Phi[mmm]Theta[ppp].txt/frd.
			NAME is optional root filename, [mmm] is meridian/orbit and [ppp] is parallel/off-axis angle while the North Pole represents on-axis direction.
			Other than [mmm]=0, Â±90, Â±180, Â±270 are skipped.
		</p>
		<p><strong>MF 3D</strong> filters and decodes either horizontal or vertical plane and angle value from filenames compatible with Four Audio Monkey Forest.
			The syntax follows: NAME V[mmm]H[ppp].txt/frd.
			NAME is optional root filename, [mmm] is meridian/orbit and [ppp] is parallel/off-axis angle while the North Pole represents on-axis direction.
			Other than [mmm]=0, Â±90, Â±180, Â±270 are skipped.
		</p>
		<p><strong>MF 2D</strong> is variation of MF 3D.
			The syntax follows: NAME <b>V000</b>H[ppp].txt/frd for horizontal plane, and V[ppp]<b>H000</b>.txt/frd for vertical plane.
			NAME is optional root filename and [ppp] is off-axis angle.
			Other than V000 or H000 are skipped.
		</p>
		<p>Check <strong>Swap planes</strong> to rotate Phi by +90 deg if balloon data was captured and exported from measurement system so that Phi=0/180 deg stands for vertical plane.
			Check by default with Klippel NFS.
		</p>
		<p>Test tool is provided for testing the syntax.</p>
		<h4 id="Options_Frequency_responses">Frequency responses</h4>
		<p>Mirror missing defines if VituixCAD should mirror missing measurement data:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Measurement to equal positive angle selected if negative angle is not available (or vice versa)</li>
			<li>Measurement to equal horizontal angle selected if vertical angle is not available (or vice versa)</li>
			<li>Measurement to equal absolute horizontal angle selected if vertical angle is not available (or vice versa).</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Frequency responses are interpolated between off-axis angles and planes loaded to drivers when Interpolate is checked.
			Program selects the closest off-axis angle loaded to driver when Interpolate is unchecked.
			This could cause some errors and discontinuities, but enables simple tests and projects with few responses only in Directivity chart.
		</p>
		<p>If crossover of project is active dsp, select exact or compatible device or application from DSP system combo box.
			Available options are:

		</ul>		
		<p>Selection has significant effect to frequency response of Active Peak/Notch, Bessel LP/HP and Shelving LP/HP filters,
			and to highest frequencies due to possible limit in sample rate.
			Setting is saved in project file (vxp).
		</p>
		<p>Listening distance is virtual distance from loudspeaker to listener or microphone,
			needed to calculate phase differences and amplitude relations between drivers in different locations.
			Enter typical listening distance in mm.
			Default value is 2000 mm.
		</p>
		<p>When Normalize SPL is checked, SPL traces are normalized to level of frequency responses loaded for drivers with generator voltage of 2.83 V.
			Default value is checked.
			Keep checked to avoid tuning of SPL and Power targets if listening distance is changed.
		</p>
		<p>Values in Listening window text boxes specify angle range in horizontal and vertical planes included in calculation of 'Listening window average'.
			See SPL chart and Optimizer.
		</p>
		<p>Off-axis angles listed in User hor and ver text boxes can be shown in CTA-2034 chart.
			Valid list separators are space, comma or semicolon.
			Angles should be divisible by Angle step &gt; 0.

			Intensity on cylinder surface around speaker is calculated as pressure R.M.S.
			from radial measurements, typically in a single (horizontal) plane.
		</p>
		<p>Checkboxes control which planes are included in power response and directivity index calculations; horizontal, vertical or both.</p>
		<p><strong>Half space</strong> is for half space designs; speakers flush mounted to wall.
			Angles &gt;90 deg are excluded from power response and DI calculation, and constant 3.01 dB is added to all DI responses.

		</p>
		<p><strong>Corner</strong> is for quarter space designs; speakers integrated to inner corner of walls.
			Angles &gt;45 deg in horizontal plane and &gt;90 deg in vertical plane are excluded from power response and DI calculation, and constant 6.02 dB is added to all DI responses.
			Directivity chart shows hor -45...+45 deg and ver -90...+90 deg only.
		</p>
		<p>Common boxed speakers and dipoles should be measured and simulated to full space with measurement data 0...
			Â±180 deg.
		</p>
		<p>Check <strong>Listening window DI</strong> to use listening window average as DI reference instead of selected reference angle.</p>
		<p>Check <strong>CTA-2034-A power weights</strong> to calculate sound power response (SP) using angle weighting factors published in CTA-2034-A.
			Factors are specified with constant angle step of 10 degrees.
			Factors between specified angles are calculated with spline interpolation.<br>
			Note 1: Weighting factors are calculated with traditional integral sine if 'CTA-2034-A power weights' is unchecked or
			angle step of simulated off-axis angles is not constant.<br>
			Note 2: CTA-2034-A table with 5 deg angle step is ignored (due to bugs) though simulated angle step is 5 degrees or less.</p>
		<p>Angle density of simulated and visualized off-axis directions is selected with <strong>Angle step</strong> list box.
			Available options are 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 deg.
			Off-axis angles loaded to drivers are simulated when 0 deg is selected.
			Initial value is 10 deg.

		<h5>Impedance models</h5>
		<p>Enclosure tool can use two different impedance models:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Basic impedance model</strong>.
				Exponential curve fitted with two impedance points: Z1k and Z10k.<br>
				Z<sub>L(j&omega;)</sub> = K(j&omega;)<sup>n</sup><br>
				This is primary model used for impedance response calculation if both Z1k and Z10k are greater than zero.
				Values should be greater or equal to Re.<br>
				<br>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Extended impedance model</strong> described in detail in the paper Frequency Dependence of Damping and Compliance in Loudspeaker Suspensions by Knud Thorborg, Carsten Tinggaard, Finn Agerkvist and Claus Futtrup, published in JAES Volume 58 Issue 6 pp.
				472-486; June 2010.<br>
				Loudspeaker equivalent circuit (seen from electrical side):<br>
				<img alt="equivalent_circuit.png" src="images/equivalent_circuit.png"><br>
				Calculation rules if all parameters of extended impedance model are not applied:<br>
				* Semi-inductance Ke is used if bound inductance Le is blank or zero<br>
				* Bound inductance Le is used if semi-inductance Ke is blank or zero<br>
				* Shunt resistance Rss is ignored (=infinite) if blank or zero.<br>
				This is secondary model used for impedance response calculation if Z1k or Z10k or both are blank or zero<br>
				Extracting of Le, Leb, Ke and Rss from impedance curve on manufacturer's data sheet or impedance measurement is possible with <strong>Extended Z model solver</strong>
				located in Calculate T/S parameters window.<br>
				<strong>Note!</strong> Re, fs, Rms, Mms, Cms or Vas, Sd and Bl should be entered or calculated and &gt;0 before extraction of extended Z model parameters.<br>
				<img alt="extended_solver.png" src="images/extended_solver.png"><br>
				Load free air impedance response file (txt,zma).
				Press <strong>Solve</strong> button to start.
				Optimizer searches Le, Leb, Ke and Rss giving close to free air target.
				Parameters can be accepted for the driver with <strong>Apply</strong> button if sum of squared error is less than 0.4.
				Error field is red if result is not acceptable and cannot be applied for the driver.

		<h5>Solving parameters of passive and bass reflex radiators</h5>
		<img class="indent1" alt="passive_solver.png" src="images/passive_solver.png">
		<p>Some parameters of passive/vented radiators can be specified by comparing simulated impedance response
			to impedance response measured from known test system.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Measure impedance response of test system with active driver(s) and passive/vented radiator(s).
				Volume of the box should be known.
				Do not fill the box with absorbing material.
				T/S parameters of active driver should be known.
				Measure T/S parameters before this test if manufacturer's data is not reliable.
				Passive radiator(s) can have extra mass, but accurate value should be known or measured.</li>
			<li>Simulate the same system with Enclosure tool.
				Verify that all known parameters of the driver, box and passive/vented radiator match with measured system.
				Enter accurate value of possible extra mass to Extra [g] in Passive group.
				Set initial values to unknown Box parameters; Qa=50, Ql=50-100.
				Set Passive Qmp=15 or Vent Qp=100 if not informed by the manufacturer.</li>
			<li>Load measured impedance response to impedance chart as an overlay.
				Magnitude response to left Y axis and phase response to right Y axis.</li>
			<li>Click Solve button in Passive or Vent Rear 1 group to open radiator solver window.</li>
			<li>Verify that magnitude response overlay is selected to Target magnitude list box.
				Check Target phase and verify that phase response overlay in selected to list box
				if measured phase is valid for iteration.</li>
			<li>Adjust Frequency limits. Minimum ca. octave below lower peak, and maximum ca. octave above upper peak of the measurement.</li>
			<li>Select parameters you want to modify with the solver.				
				If all parameters of passive radiator need adjustment, check Vap, Qmp and Mmp.
				You can modify for example Qmp alone if Vap and Mmp are already measured with some accurate method such as Klippel hardware with AN57.
				Vent parameters are Qp and End correction (unchecked by default).
				Box Ql can stay constant 50-100 so leave it unchecked. Check Qa to allow modification.</li>
			<li>Click Solve button to start iteration.
				If iteration fails and simulation does not match with the measurement,
				adjust initial values of parameters manually and Solve again.</li>
			<li>If the result is acceptable (error very close to 0), you can modify parameters of passive radiator in driver database.
				Before closing Edit parameters window with OK button, enter Cms=0 and Rms=0 that program would calculate correct values from iterated Qmp, Vap, Mmp and fs.</li>

			It is recommended that all files in the list are measured with common parameters and settings: rotation center, distance, level, signal type, sampling rate, MLS sequence length etc.
		</p>
		<h5>Impulse response files</h5>
		<p>Load impulse responses to file list with Open button or Drag&amp;Drop.
			More measurement files can be added to the list by pressing Shift key while dropping or clicking Open button in file selection dialog box.
			Supported IR file formats are ARTA .pir, CLIO Standard/QC .mls/mlsi (4.x, 6.x, 7.x), CLIO Pocket .crp, WAV mono/stereo
			(16-bit PCM, 24-bit PCM, 32-bit PCM, 32-bit IEEE, 64-bit PCM, 64-bit IEEE) and MLSSA/SE .txt.
			Wav files may contain proprietary/custom chunks such as FLLR or APx5.
			Program asks sample rate if .txt file does not have valid MLSSA ASCII header.

		<h5>FFT analysis</h5>
		<p>Impulse response is multiplied by window function (sample by sample) before conversion to frequency domain with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
			Typical purpose of window function is to crop room reflections from measurement data.
			Window function could have one or two sides.
			Left side is activated with <strong>Left window</strong> checkbox.
			Maximum point of window function and phase response of exported frequency responses are set with <strong>Reference time</strong>.
			Reference time is typically set to the first sharp and high (positive) peak of impulse response to produce close to minimum phase response at high frequencies.
			<strong>Get</strong> button locates reference time to the highest absolute peak of impulse response.
			Manual fine tuning may be needed.
			Name of Reference time will change to <strong> Start time </strong> if Left window is disabled.
			<strong>Right window</strong> is 'main gate' for measurement data after Reference/Start time.
			Endpoint of right window is typically set in the beginning of the first stong boundary reflection (not diffraction).
		</p>
		<p>Available <strong>Window functions</strong> are Rectangular, Bartlett, Blackman, Blackman-Harris, Blackman-Nuttall, Cosine 0.50/0.75/1.0, Hamming, Hanning, Nuttall and Tukey 0.25/0.50/0.75.
			Flat top functions Rectangular and Tukey allow some movement or location differences or timing differences of measured objects so that impulse does not attenuate too much or flow totally out of time window.
			Recommended functions for driver measurements with rotation table is Tukey 0.50.

		</p>
		<p>Uncheck Far field measurements.
			Near field frequency responses are added by clicking folder button on the right or dropping files into the list.
			You can have multiple responses, usually near field of cone(s) and port(s) or passive radiator(s).<br>
			
			Check BS if the cone/port/passive is located on the front panel creating baffle step to on-axis direction.
			Leave BS unchecked if cone/port/passive is located on the side, top, bottom or rear panel because there's no baffle step to on-axis.<br>
			
			Enter diameter [mm] or area [cm2] of radiating surface to enable automating scaling to far field and
			directity simulation for ports/passives located on other than front panel.<br>
			
			Enter travel difference to active cone on the front panel at typical listening distance (2-4 m) on-axis to Delay [mm] field.
			For instance, delay is ca. panel width / 2 + box depth if the port/passive radiator locates in the middle of rear panel.
			Delay should normally be zero for active cones on the front panel.<br>
			
			Scaling can be adjusted with Diam [mm], Area [cm2] and Count of radiators or Scale [dB] in response rows, and
			for total low frequency part via Scale or Distance text box by entering a value or by Up/Down keys.

			Directivity of far field HF responses is used at LF when 'Force to Gradient' is unchecked.<br>
			Highest frequency using ideal gradient pattern is adjusted with 'below Hz' text box.
			Directivity is blended within ideal gradient range and transition frequency.
			Narrowest blending range is one octave.
		</p>
		<p>For baffle diffraction there are three options available:
			No baffle loss, Sphere baffle step (adjustable nominal frequency) or Diffraction response.
			'Diffraction response 5-30 m' can be selected by clicking folder button or dropping file into text box.
			Baffle effect response simulated to the longest ever possible listening distance is selected into this text box.
			Response type must be 'baffle step' i.e. scaling 0...+6 dB.
		</p>		
		<h5>Low frequency part with Far field measurements</h5>
		<p>Low frequency response list must have equal off-axis angles (with the same angle coding in filenames) with high frequency response list.
			Otherwise LF and HF responses cannot be paired.

			Default on-axis response is 0 degrees in horizontal plane.
			Merged responses (graph below High frequency part) to particular angle can be previewed by clicking corresponding file from HF response list.

		<p>Enter actual measurement distance in mm to Distance text box.</p>
		<p>Optional 'Diffraction response X mm' can be selected by clicking folder button or dropping file into text box.

		<h5>Transition</h5>
		<p>Transition from low frequency to high frequency part can be adjusted manually via Frequency text box, graph cursor or Up/Down keys.
		</p>
		<p>Warning is given with red background color if transition frequency exceeds maximum near field frequency of the largest low frequency radiator.
			f<sub>NFmax</sub> = c/pi/Dd (c = 344.0 m/s).

		<h5>Output</h5>
		<p>Choose which items you want to output.
			Create merged responses will combine low frequency and high frequency responses into individual response files.
			Extended data will combine LF and HF responses into a single file, having LspCAD 6 extended data format.
			Merged responses are routed to main program for currently selected driver in Drivers tab by checking Feed speaker before saving.
		</p>
		<p>Output response can be limited within visible frequency range by checking 'Visible frequency range only'.
			Normally it should be unchecked to avoid forced extrapolation which is never accurate.
			Limiting can improve e.g. impulse response graph in case LF (or HF) part of merged response is inaccurate due low SNR at infra frequencies such as <= self-resonance of passive radiator.
		</p>
		<p>Merged responses are exported as minimum-phase by checking Minimum phase.
			Measured and entered delays are lost and all responses at all frequencies are normalized to the same acoustic center = 0 mm.
			Color of merged phase response is lime in the chart.
		</p>
		<p>Excess group delay of HF response at transition frequency x 1.4 is added to merged minimum phase response by checking with GD of HF.
			This option saves measured delay (at transition frequency x 1.4) and delay adjusted by user.
		</p>
		<p>Minimum phase options may be needed if measured far field HF responses are not minimum-phase at transition frequency, though radiator is actually minimum-phase.
			Significant error is possible with some measurement programs if IR time window is short.
			Forcing to calculated minimum phase is not recommended if responses are measured with dual channel gear and phase error at transition frequency is just few degrees.

			Delay can be iterated manually with delay [Âµs] or distance [mm] text boxes, or with a solver.
			Three response measurements are needed.
			They should be measured at the same spot in the middle elevation of the drivers,
			or at normal listening distance and elevation if speaker will be designed with on-axis responses only.
			Two measurements from individual drivers and one measurement when both drivers are connected in parallel to power amplifier, maintaining supply voltage for individual drivers.
		</p>
		<p>Load first driver response (usually mid-woofer) to <strong>LF measurement</strong> text box with <strong>Open</strong> button or Drag&amp;Drop.
			<span style="color: red;">Red</span> curve is shown in graph.
			Check <strong>MP</strong> on the right if response is not minimum-phase i.e.
			excess group delay is not yet removed with measurement program or Minimum phase function in Calculator tool.
		</p>
		<p>Load second driver response (usually tweeter) to <strong>HF measurement</strong> text box with <strong>Open</strong> button or Drag&amp;Drop.
			<span style="color: blue;">Blue</span> curve is shown in graph.
			Check <strong>MP</strong> if response is not yet minimum-phase.
		</p>
		<p>Load sum response of drivers to <strong>Sum measurement</strong> text box with <strong>Open</strong> button or Drag&amp;Drop.
			<span style="color: magenta;">Magenta</span> curve is shown in the graph.
			Sum measurement does not need minimum phase extraction, because it's phase response is irrelevant for this operation.
		</p>
		<p>Adjust <strong>Frequency range</strong> limits which are also constraints for the solver.
			Exclude frequencies which are not valid for solving the delay.
		</p>
		<p>Adjust <strong>delay</strong> in microseconds [Âµs] or <strong>distance</strong> in millimeters [mm] until
			<span style="color: green;">Calculated Sum</span> (green curve) is close or equal to
			<span style="color: magenta;">Sum measurement</span>.
			Scale Sum measurement either manually or by clicking <strong>dB</strong> label, if SPL at low frequencies is not equal to Calculated sum (green).
			Solver can be started with <strong>Solve LF delay</strong> button to seach minimum squared error between Sum measurement and Calculated Sum.
			Sometimes solver may need decent initial delay value to find correct local minimum.
			Error value is high with red background if solver did not find response match.
		</p>
		<p>Difference in acoustic centers should be entered as a delay to Delay Âµs parameter in Drivers tab with unidirectional drivers such as closed or vented enclosures and horns.
			Not to Z mm coordinate of driver instance in crossover to avoid probable response summing error to off-axis &gt;60 deg.
		</p>
		<p>Difference in acoustic centers should be entered as a distance to Z mm coordinate of driver instance in crossover with dipole drivers to enable more accurate geometry simulation to off-axis &gt;60 deg.</p>
		<p><strong>Note1</strong>: This method is not necessarily accurate due to subjective nature and limited radiator support of minimum phase extraction.</p>
		<p><strong>Note2</strong>: This method is not recommended for off-axis, power response and directivity index simulation because delay/distance difference between acoustic centers is not constant value to all directions 0...Â±180 deg with different radiator types such as domes, cones, horns etc.
			and enclosure types such as boxes and dipoles.
			Time align feature has been added to support at least simulation of on-axis and listening window responses.
			Simulation options are limited for users who don't have adequate measurement gear for accurate and stable timing measurements with dual or semi-dual channel connection and measurement mode.

		<p>SPL Trace tool can capture frequency and impedance responses from bitmap loaded from file or pasted from the clipboard.
			Several image file types are supported such as png, jpg, bmp and gif.
			Some external tool or print screen is needed for copying bitmap to clipboard from datasheet (pdf) or web page.
			Snipping Tool installed in Windows 10 works fine.

		<p>Extracting of responses:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Open image file (File-&gt;Open image or Ctrl+O) or paste from the clipboard (Edit -&gt; Paste image or Ctrl+V).</li>
			<li>Set frequency boundaries: Point and drag the lowest labeled frequency value in the graph with magenta cursor.
				Enter the same value to text box on the right side of magenta button, or adjust value with up/down arrow keys or mouse wheel.
				Uncheck 'Log f axis' if frequency axis is linear.
				Point and drag the highest labeled frequency value with orange cursor.
				Enter or adjust the same value to text box on the right side of orange button.
			</li>
			<li>Set SPL boundaries: Point and drag the lowest labeled Y-value in SPL axis with blue cursor.
				Enter or adjust the same value to Low amplitude text box.
				Point and drag the highest labeled Y-value in SPL axis with green cursor.
				Enter or adjust the same value to High amplitude text box.
			</li>
			<li>Set impedance boundaries: Point and drag the lowest labeled Y-value in impedance axis with red cursor.
				Enter or adjust the same value to Low impedance text box.
				Point and drag the highest labeled Y-value in impedance axis with cyan cursor.
				Enter or adjust the same value to High impedance text box.
			</li>
			<li>Select impedance axis type with 'Log Z axis' checkbox.
				Linear scale (unchecked) has absolute increments and typically starts from zero Ohms.
				For example from 0 to 60 Ohms with steps of 10 Ohms.
				Intervals of logarithmic scale are ratios, and scale starts <strong>above</strong> zero Ohms.
				For example 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 Ohms.
			</li>
			<li>Move mouse cursor inside the graph area and check that Hz, dB and Ohm values in the status line are calculated correctly.<br>
				<strong>Warning!</strong> Paste and File open commands reset previous settings if image size changes.
			</li>
			<li>Erase gridlines within chart area if luminance of line color is &lt;90 % and color difference to response traces is small.
				No need to erase if gridlines are very light gray (or dotted line) and response traces are thick with saturated color (red, green, blue, magenta, cyan).<br>
				Click <strong>X Grids</strong> button to start erasing.
				Point with crosshair cursor the lines where all horizontal and vertical gridlines are found,
				but the cursor lines crosses response traces as little as possible.
				Accept with left click.
				Gridlines (with luminance &lt;90 %) should be gone.
			</li>
			<li>You can use Image rubber for cleaning vicinity of response curves.
				Crossing off-axis responses could interfere tracing of on-axis and impedance responses.<br>
				<strong>Warning!</strong> Do not cut on-axis or impedance responses too much because Undo is not available.
			</li>
			<li>Trace amplitude response.
				Click <strong>Trace SPL</strong> button and then starting point of frequency response at the lowest visible frequency.
				Click again few pixels further if tracing was not started.
				Press and hold Ctrl key while clicking to prevent deletion of few previous points.
				This helps tracing e.g. impedance curve with sharp Q peak.
				Traced path is marked with thick red overlay line.
				If tracing is interrupted or distracted in an intersection, you can correct the path by clicking a point few pixels after the problem.
				You can also restart from earlier position or beginning as many times you like.<br>
				Check Manual to trace SPL response manually instead of automatic color detection. Click each corner of the curve.
			</li>
			<li>You can use Trace rubber for cleaning bad points of traced curve.
				For example short jumps above or below correct path.
				Erased parts will be interpolated when the response is exported to a file.<br>
				Check Options -&gt; Smooth 1/12 oct.
				to remove small peaks and tiny steps due to pixels of original bitmap.
				Smoothing of 1/12 oct.
				is applied to exported responses.<br>
				Default density of export is 48 points/octave.
				Lower densities are available in Options menu, but not recommended if responses are created for VituixCAD.
			</li>
			<li>Export amplitude response with <strong>Export</strong> button (left) after tracing is completed and red overlay line looks fine.
				Enter filename and select extension (txt or frd).
				Phase response is calculated automatically as minimum phase.
				Program estimates slopes of frequency response extensions below and above visible range.
			</li>
			<li>Trace impedance response.
				Click <strong>Trace Z</strong> button and then starting point of impedance response at the lowest visible frequency.<br>
				Check Manual to trace Z response manually instead of automatic color detection. Click each corner of the curve.
			</li>
			<li>Enter voice coil resistance of the driver to Re text box.
				Initial value is 95% of minimum traced Z.
			</li>
			<li>Export impedance response with <strong>Export</strong> button (right)...</li>

		<h4>Background</h4>
		<p>Needless to say, filters are the brain and heart of speakers. As music evolves over time - we accept 
			the parameters of Time as Suprime (highest  important) than the STATIONARY frequency response.
			This does not mean a limited and curved frequency response.</p>
		<p>Proper full band signal reproduction requires all spectral components to be arranged with their exact amplitudes, 
			which are constantly changing and are crucially dependent on the time domain.</p>
		<p>The idea arose when as a musician (bass guitar) and as a sound director I listened to the general (mixed)
			sound from two-way and three-way speakers. There were no micro details, natural timbres, attack
			(increase) and decrease (fading reverberation) in time and space. There was no sense of a specific scene and no directives from
			individual instruments and vocals. The big ambition for me was after reading a study by R. Heiser and later Lipshitz, Vanderkooy, Kreskovsky.
			F.Brooke's articles "Le filtre ideal" in L'AUDIOPHILE was no small stimulus and last but not least. The Loudspeaker Cookbook by V. Dickason has been my
			desktop reading for many years.  Of course - the biggest challenge was the "hidden" delays (resonances) of the filters, higher than the first order.
			This technology is very important, but it is not a wizard panacea for all other problems and omissions.
			We can not talk about good Timing - if there is a band with reverse polarity.
			But it is not superfluous to know - before measuring the impedances and frequency responses for the future project, an appropriate selection of speakers must be made,
			incl. preliminary solution for optimal shear frequencies. Ie - together with the choice we specify: The self resonance of each high frequency (of course
			and middle driver)  must be one / two octaves farther (down) from the filter frequency.
			The rule is general alignment according to the quietest speaker. Ensuring flat (constant) impedance
			for each filter - too. Working with a simulation program is essential (help).
			Pre-planning the possibility for precise movement between the centers of the adjacent drivers (speakers) through separate enclosures (boxes) - mandatory.
			Precise observance of results (values) from the filters, including displacement (delay) - too.</p>
		<p>If we get as close as possible to a better Step Response - this would be adequate to the original input signal without time distortion.
			And then after the obtained accuracy, precision and fidelity can be speaks of musicality and emotionality, if contained in the RECORD.</p>
		<p>Over the years we have tried different solutions to the problem - with the classic First Order,
			incl. serial filter, Baekgaard (Christensen), Cauer (elliptical) filters, combinations Bessel (Spica),
			Linkwitz, Elipson, Urei Time-Aligned crossover, JMLC, Duelund, Bodzio (SoundEasy/Ultimate Equalizer),
			Isaac MCN, Jeff Bagby's Software, LinearX LEAP (in memoriam)... they all had their pros and cons.</p>
		<p>The first order is "lost" in the driver's frequency response curve. The desired filters must also be dominant in relation to the speaker's own slope.
			The main goal for me was - to fill well the transient response, flat plateau without 
			shaking (approximately &plusmn;5 %) and maximum linear frequency response (&plusmn;0.7 dB).</p>
		<p>I have to admit that there is a good solution with DSP, but not for those professional users and audiophiles who want an analog path from input to output.</p>
